      "1": {
        "question": "Is my data secure and private?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. We use enterprise-grade encryption and never store your photos permanently. Your photos are automatically deleted 30 days after your subscription ends, or you can request deletion anytime. We don't share your data with third parties-not even your boss, we promise."
      },
      "2": {
        "question": "How much does it cost?",
        "answer": "When you sign up, you get a free test generation in a predefined style so you can see the quality. After that: Try Once package for $5 (2 generations), Individual plan at $24/month (6 generations/month), or Pro plan at $59/month (20 generations/month). Annual plans save you more. Credits never expire, so you can hoard them like digital gold. Each generation uses 10 credits and produces 4 variations."
      },
      "3": {
        "question": "What types of photos work best?",
        "answer": "Any clear photo of your face works! Selfies and casual photos work great. The better quality your selfie, the better quality your result. The less we need to guess, the better."
      },
      "4": {
        "question": "Can I use these photos for my LinkedIn, website, etc.?",
        "answer": "Yes! All generated photos are yours to use for any professional purpose - LinkedIn, company websites, business cards, presentations, and more. You receive high-resolution files (1024x1024px) perfect for any professional use. Go ahead, look amazing everywhere."
      },
      "5": {
        "question": "How does the AI photo generation work?",
        "answer": "Our AI analyzes your uploaded photo using advanced facial recognition and style transfer algorithms (we promise it's not magic, just really smart math). It creates professional headshots by applying corporate photography styles while maintaining your unique facial features and identity-yes, you'll still look like you, just more polished."
      },
      "6": {
        "question": "How many photos do I get per generation?",
        "answer": "Each generation produces 4 different professional variations of your photo. You can download all of them and choose your favorites. This gives you options for different contexts or preferences-serious LinkedIn, friendly website, you get the idea."
      },
      "7": {
        "question": "Do you support team photos or just individual headshots?",
        "answer": "Currently, we focus on individual professional headshots. Each person needs to upload their own photo for the best results (but hey, at least they don't all need to be in the same room). We're working on team photo capabilities for future updates, because group shots are hard."
      },
      "8": {
        "question": "How long does it take?",
        "answer": "About 60 seconds per person. Upload your selfie, and you'll have professional headshots ready in under a minute. No waiting weeks for a photoshoot."
      },
      "9": {
        "question": "Will the photos look professional and real?",
        "answer": "Yes. Our AI maintains your unique features while applying professional photography styles. You'll still look like you, just polished and professional. See the gallery above for real examples."
