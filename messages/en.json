          "question": "Is my data secure and private?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. We use enterprise-grade encryption and never store your photos permanently. Your uploaded photos are processed and then automatically deleted within 30 days. We never share your data with third parties."
        },
        "2": {
          "question": "How much does it cost?",
          "answer": "We offer flexible pricing starting at $5 for a one-time trial (4 credits), or monthly subscriptions starting at $29/month for 100 credits. Credits never expire, so you can use them whenever you need professional photos."
        },
        "3": {
          "question": "What if I'm not satisfied with the results?",
          "answer": "We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not happy with your professional photos, we'll refund your purchase, no questions asked. We're confident in our AI's quality, but we want you to be completely satisfied."
        },
        "4": {
          "question": "What types of photos work best?",
          "answer": "Any clear photo of your face works! Selfies, casual photos, or even group photos where you're clearly visible. The AI works best with good lighting and a clear view of your face, but it's surprisingly good at handling various photo qualities."
        },
        "5": {
          "question": "Can I use these photos for my LinkedIn, website, etc.?",
          "answer": "Yes! All generated photos are yours to use for any professional purpose - LinkedIn, company websites, business cards, presentations, and more. You receive high-resolution files (1024x1024px) perfect for any professional use."
        },
        "6": {
          "question": "How does the AI photo generation work?",
          "answer": "Our AI analyzes your uploaded photo using advanced facial recognition and style transfer algorithms. It creates professional headshots by applying corporate photography styles while maintaining your unique facial features and identity."
        },
        "7": {
          "question": "How many photos do I get per generation?",
          "answer": "Each generation produces 3-4 different professional variations of your photo. You can download all of them and choose your favorites. This gives you options for different contexts or preferences."
        },
        "8": {
          "question": "Do you support team photos or just individual headshots?",
          "answer": "Currently, we focus on individual professional headshots. Each person needs to upload their own photo for the best results. We're working on team photo capabilities for future updates."
