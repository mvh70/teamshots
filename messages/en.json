      "3": {
        "question": "What types of photos work best?",
        "answer": "Any clear photo of your face works! Selfies and casual photos work great. The better quality your selfie, the better quality your result. The less we need to guess, the better."
      },
      "4": {
        "question": "Can I use these photos for my LinkedIn, website, etc.?",
        "answer": "Yes! All generated photos are yours to use for any professional purpose - LinkedIn, company websites, business cards, presentations, and more. You receive high-resolution files (1024x1024px) perfect for any professional use. Go ahead, look amazing everywhere."
      },
      "5": {
        "question": "How does the photo generation work?",
        "answer": "Our system analyzes your uploaded photo and creates professional headshots by applying polished photography styles. You'll still look like you, just more professional and polished. See the gallery above for real examples."
      },
      "6": {
        "question": "How many photos do I get per generation?",
        "answer": "Each generation produces 4 different professional variations of your photo. You can download all of them and choose your favorites. This gives you options for different contexts or preferences-serious LinkedIn, friendly website, you get the idea."
      },
      "7": {
        "question": "Do you support team photos or just individual headshots?",
