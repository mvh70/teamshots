      "q1": {
        "question": "How much do professional headshots cost per person?",
        "answer": "Traditional professional headshots typically cost $150-400 per person, including photographer fees, session time, and retouching. With TeamShotsPro AI headshots, the cost starts at $29 per person for teams, with volume discounts available for larger groups."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "What are the hidden costs of traditional corporate photography?",
        "answer": "Hidden costs include: employee time away from work ($50+/hour × 30-60 minutes per person), administrative coordination (4+ hours of scheduling), retouching fees ($35+ per person), usage rights fees, and travel expenses. These can easily double the quoted photographer rate."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "How much can teams save with AI headshots?",
        "answer": "Teams typically save 70-85% compared to traditional photography. For a 25-person team, traditional photography costs around $6,000-8,000 when including all hidden costs, while AI headshots cost approximately $500-700 total."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "Do AI headshots include commercial usage rights?",
        "answer": "Yes, TeamShotsPro includes full commercial usage rights with every plan at no extra cost. Traditional photographers often charge $350+ extra for commercial usage rights and travel fees."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "How long does it take to get AI headshots?",
        "answer": "AI headshots are generated in approximately 60 seconds after uploading a selfie. Traditional photography requires scheduling (often weeks in advance), the session itself (30-60 minutes), and waiting for retouched photos (1-2 weeks)."
