# Copy & Text Generation

## Tone
- Professional with a smile - make users feel good without trying too hard
- Conversational but credible
- Occasional wit, never forced humor
- Treat users like intelligent people (because they are)

## Voice
- User perspective: "You" and "your" (not "we" or "the user")
- Exception: When representing TeamShots (e.g., "We'll send you an email")

## Writing Style
- Concise and punchy without sacrificing clarity
- Active voice preferred
- One idea per sentence
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)

## Capitalization & Punctuation
- Sentence case only (capital at start of sentence)
- Proper nouns: TeamShots, Hetzner, Stripe
- No title case, no em-dashes (—)
- Exclamation marks sparingly (only when genuinely exciting)

## Language to Avoid
- Corporate jargon (synergy, leverage, utilize, stakeholder)
- Buzzwords (disrupt, revolutionize, cutting-edge, game-changer)
- Spam triggers (FREE, URGENT, ACT NOW, CLICK HERE, BUY NOW, GUARANTEE)
- ALL CAPS (except acronyms)
- Passive voice when active is clearer

## Internationalization
- Base: English (en) and Spanish (es)
- Check all language files in `src/messages/`
- Update ALL locales when changing copy
- Maintain same tone across translations

## UI Text
- Action-focused: "Download photo" not "Photo download"
- Clear outcome: "Generate 4 photos (4 credits)" not just "Generate"

## Error Messages
Format: What happened + why + what to do
- "Your upload failed. The file is too large (max 10MB). Try a smaller image."

## Marketing Copy
- Lead with benefit: "Professional team photos in 60 seconds"
- Not features: "AI-powered headshot generation platform"

## Emails
**Personalization:**
- Use recipient's name: "Hi Sarah," not "Hi there,"
- Reference specific actions: "Your 4 photos are ready"

**Images:**
- Max 1 image per email (or none)
- 80:20 text-to-image ratio minimum

**Subject Lines:**
- Short (< 50 characters)
- Match email content
- No ALL CAPS, no excessive punctuation

**Content:**
- Max 2-3 links per email
- Clear sender: "TeamShots" not "noreply@"

**Example:**
```
Subject: Your team photos are ready, Sarah

Hi Sarah,

Your 4 professional headshots are ready to download.

Need different backgrounds? Regenerate with your remaining 6 credits.

- TeamShots
```

## Audience
- Primary: HR professionals (non-technical but capable)
- Write for humans, not job titles
- No condescension, no dumbing down
