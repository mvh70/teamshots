# Business Model

## Pricing Model
**Credit-based system with subscriptions + top-ups**

No free tier. All features require credits.

## Pricing Structure

### Credits System
- **1 generation = 4 credits** (produces 4 photo variations)
- **Credits roll over** month-to-month (never expire)
- **Display format:** "100 credits (25 generations)" - emphasize credits for psychological impact

### Try Once (One-time Purchase)
```
Price: $5
Credits: 4 (1 generation)
Purpose: Low-friction proof of concept
```

### Starter Subscription
```
Monthly: $24/month â†’ 100 credits/month (25 generations)
Annual: $245/year â†’ 100 credits/month (Save $43/year, 15% discount)

Top-ups: $0.90 per 4 credits (minimum 20 credits)
```

### Pro Subscription  
```
Monthly: $59/month â†’ 280 credits/month (70 generations)
Annual: $600/year â†’ 280 credits/month (Save $108/year, 15% discount)

Top-ups: $0.60 per 4 credits (minimum 20 credits)
Pro users get 33% cheaper top-ups than Starter
```

## Pricing Psychology

**Why Credits (not just "generations"):**
- Larger numbers feel more valuable (100 > 25)
- Gamification effect increases engagement  
- Creates psychological distance from money (like casino chips)
- Users less likely to cancel with accumulated credits (sunk cost)

**Why Rollover:**
- Reduces anxiety ("use it or lose it")
- Increases perceived value
- Reduces churn (users stay even in low-usage months)
- Builds loyalty (accumulated credits = switching cost)

**Why Annual Discount:**
- 15% = industry standard, feels meaningful
- Upfront cash improves business cash flow
- Higher commitment = better retention
- Display as dollar savings: "Save $108/year" (not "15% off")

**Top-up Strategy:**
- Tier-based pricing encourages upgrades
- Minimum purchase (20 credits) prevents micro-transactions
- Pro discount (33% off) rewards commitment

## Revenue Streams

### Primary
1. **Subscriptions** - Recurring monthly/annual revenue (individual + team plans)
2. **Top-ups** - Additional revenue when users exceed base credits
3. **Try Once** - Acquisition funnel entry point
4. **Team/company plans** - B2B recurring revenue

### Future (Post-MVP)
- Enterprise pricing
- API access for developers

## Unit Economics

**Using direct Gemini API (not Replicate) = 30-50% cost savings**

### Per Generation Costs & Margins

| Item | Cost | Revenue | Margin |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| Gemini API (4 variations) | $0.10 | - | - |
| Infrastructure (monthly/user) | ~$0.50 | - | - |
| **Try Once** | $0.10 | $5.00 | 98% |
| **Starter base** | $0.10 | $0.96/gen | 90% |
| **Starter top-up** | $0.10 | $0.90/4cr | 89% |
| **Pro base** | $0.10 | $0.84/gen | 88% |
| **Pro top-up** | $0.10 | $0.60/4cr | 83% |

### Monthly User Economics (Starter)

Assumptions:
- User on Starter monthly: $24/month
- Uses all 100 credits (25 generations)
- Buys 1 top-up (20 credits, 5 generations): $4.50

```
Monthly Revenue:        $28.50
Gemini API costs:       $3.00 (30 generations Ã— $0.10)
Infrastructure costs:   $0.50
Total costs:            $3.50
Gross Margin:           88%
```

### Monthly User Economics (Pro)

Assumptions:
- User on Pro monthly: $59/month
- Uses all 280 credits (70 generations)
- Buys 1 top-up (40 credits, 10 generations): $6.00

```
Monthly Revenue:        $65.00
Gemini API costs:       $8.00 (80 generations Ã— $0.10)
Infrastructure costs:   $0.50
Total costs:            $8.50
Gross Margin:           87%
```

**All scenarios maintain 85%+ gross margins.**

## Conversion Funnel Strategy

```
Try Once ($5) 
    â†“ 
User sees quality, wants more
    â†“
"Subscribe to Starter - Save 81%"
$24/mo seems reasonable vs. $5 per generation
    â†“
Heavy users exceed 100 credits
    â†“
Top-ups at $0.90 feel expensive
    â†“
"Upgrade to Pro - Get 180 more credits + 33% off top-ups"
    â†“
Pro subscription ($59/mo)
```
