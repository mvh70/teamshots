## 1. Introduction

Welcome to TeamShotsPro ("we," "our," or "us"). We operate teamshotspro.com and photoshotspro.com (collectively, the "Services").

We are committed to protecting your data. This policy outlines how we handle your personal and biometric information. We operate under strict data protection principles aligned with the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP) and the GDPR.

## 2. Information We Collect

### A. Account & Team Data

**Identity:** Name, email address, password (hashed), and language preference.

**Team Data:** For teamshotspro.com users, we store team names, roles, and member email addresses managed by Team Admins.

### B. Biometric & Image Data

**Important:** By uploading photos to our Service, you provide explicit consent for us to process your biometric data (facial features) as required under GDPR Article 9 for special category data. This processing is necessary to provide the AI headshot generation service you have requested.

**Input Data:** We collect the photos ("Selfies") you upload for the purpose of generating professional headshots.

**Process Data:** Our AI analyzes facial features in your uploads to map them onto professional styles. We do not use your photos to train any AI models. Your images are processed solely to generate your specific outputs and are not used for model improvement or training.

**Output Data:** We store the resulting AI-generated images. All generated images are AI-created and are not real photographs.

**Content Moderation:** Uploaded photos are automatically scanned using AI to detect and reject inappropriate content. This includes, but is not limited to: nudity, sexually explicit material, violent imagery, hate symbols, and content depicting minors. This moderation happens before processing and no inappropriate images are stored.

### C. Financial Data

We use Stripe for payment processing. We do not store your credit card details. We only retain a transaction ID and customer reference number to manage your purchases.

**Free Retries Included:** Each photo includes free retries to perfect your results. The number of retries depends on your package—see our pricing page for details.
