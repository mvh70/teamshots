## Hetzner VPS Setup

### 1. Create Hetzner Cloud Server

**Steps:**

1. Go to [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/)
2. Create new project: "TeamShots Production"
3. Add new server with these specs:

**Recommended Configuration:**
- **Location**: Nuremberg, Germany (or closest to your users)
- **Image**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **Type**: CPX21 (3 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 80GB SSD) - ~€8/month
- **Networking**: IPv4 & IPv6
- **SSH Keys**: Add your public SSH key
- **Firewall**: Create with rules:
  - Allow SSH (22) from anywhere (Coolify Cloud needs access)
  - Allow HTTP (80) from anywhere
  - Allow HTTPS (443) from anywhere
  - Allow port 8000 from anywhere (Coolify Cloud agent communication)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Hetzner VPS provisioned (CPX21 or higher)
- [ ] Server accessible via SSH with key-based authentication
- [ ] Hetzner Cloud Firewall configured (all 4 ports above)
- [ ] Server IP address noted for next steps

### 2. Initial Server Setup (Optional)

**Basic system update** (optional, but recommended):

```bash
ssh root@[YOUR_SERVER_IP]
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

**That's it!** 

The Coolify Cloud agent (installed in the next step) will automatically handle:
- ✅ Docker installation
- ✅ Docker Compose setup
- ✅ Required dependencies
- ✅ Network configuration
- ✅ Service management

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Server updated: `apt update && apt upgrade -y` (optional)
- [ ] ✅ No manual Docker installation needed - Coolify handles it!

---

## DNS Configuration

Configure DNS records at your domain registrar. See [DNS_SETUP.md](./DNS_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

**Required A Records:**
```
@ (root)     →  [YOUR_SERVER_IP]
www          →  [YOUR_SERVER_IP]
app          →  [YOUR_SERVER_IP]
```

Verify DNS propagation:
```bash
dig www.teamshots.vip +short
dig app.teamshots.vip +short
```

Both should return your server IP address.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] DNS A records configured (root, www, app)
- [ ] DNS propagation verified (`dig www.teamshots.vip`)

---

## Cloudflare Setup (Optional but Recommended)

Cloudflare provides CDN, DDoS protection, caching, and performance optimization for free. It sits between your users and your server.

### Why Use Cloudflare?

- ✅ **Free CDN** - Global content delivery network
- ✅ **DDoS Protection** - Automatic protection against attacks
- ✅ **SSL/TLS** - Additional SSL layer (Universal SSL)
- ✅ **Caching** - Reduce server load and improve speed
- ✅ **Analytics** - Traffic insights and metrics
- ✅ **Firewall** - Block malicious traffic
- ✅ **Always Online** - Shows cached version if server is down

### 1. Create Cloudflare Account

1. Go to [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email address

### 2. Add Your Domain to Cloudflare

1. Click **+ Add a Site** in Cloudflare dashboard
2. Enter your domain: `teamshots.vip`
3. Select **Free Plan** (sufficient for most use cases)
4. Click **Continue**

Cloudflare will scan your existing DNS records automatically.

### 3. Review DNS Records

Cloudflare will import your existing DNS records. Verify these are correct:

**Required A Records:**
```
Type    Name    Content              Proxy Status    TTL
A       @       [YOUR_SERVER_IP]     Proxied         Auto
A       www     [YOUR_SERVER_IP]     Proxied         Auto
A       app     [YOUR_SERVER_IP]     Proxied         Auto
```

**Important Settings:**
- **Proxy Status**: Set to **Proxied** (orange cloud ☁️) - this enables Cloudflare CDN
- **TTL**: Set to **Auto** - Cloudflare manages this automatically

### 4. Change Nameservers at Domain Registrar

Cloudflare will provide you with 2 nameservers like:
```
amber.ns.cloudflare.com
chad.ns.cloudflare.com
```

**Steps:**
1. Go to your domain registrar (where you bought teamshots.vip)
2. Find DNS/Nameserver settings
3. Replace existing nameservers with Cloudflare's nameservers
4. Save changes

**Note**: Nameserver changes can take 24-48 hours to propagate, but usually complete within a few hours.

### 5. SSL/TLS Configuration

Once nameservers are active, configure SSL/TLS:

1. Go to **SSL/TLS** → **Overview** in Cloudflare dashboard
2. Select encryption mode: **Full (strict)** ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**SSL/TLS Modes Explained:**
- ❌ **Off**: No HTTPS (not recommended)
- ❌ **Flexible**: HTTPS between user and Cloudflare, HTTP to server (not secure)
- ✅ **Full**: HTTPS everywhere, but doesn't validate server certificate
- ⭐ **Full (strict)**: HTTPS everywhere with valid certificate (BEST - use this!)

**Why Full (strict)?**
- Most secure option
- Works perfectly with Coolify's Let's Encrypt certificates
- End-to-end encryption

3. Go to **SSL/TLS** → **Edge Certificates**
4. Enable these settings:
   - ✅ **Always Use HTTPS** - Force HTTPS redirects
   - ✅ **Automatic HTTPS Rewrites** - Fix mixed content
   - ✅ **Minimum TLS Version**: TLS 1.2 (or TLS 1.3 for better security)
   - ✅ **Opportunistic Encryption** - Better performance
   - ✅ **TLS 1.3** - Enable for better security and speed

### 6. Caching Configuration

Configure caching to improve performance:

1. Go to **Caching** → **Configuration**
2. **Caching Level**: Standard
3. **Browser Cache TTL**: 4 hours (or higher for production)

**Recommended Cache Rules:**

Go to **Caching** → **Cache Rules** → **Create Rule**:

**Rule 1: Cache Static Assets**
- **Rule name**: Cache Static Assets
- **When incoming requests match**: Custom filter expression
- **Field**: URI Path
- **Operator**: contains
- **Value**: `/static/` OR `/images/` OR `/css/` OR `/js/`
- **Then**: Cache eligibility → Eligible
- **Edge TTL**: 1 month

**Rule 2: Don't Cache API Routes**
- **Rule name**: Bypass API Cache
- **When incoming requests match**: Custom filter expression
- **Field**: URI Path
- **Operator**: starts with
- **Value**: `/api/`
- **Then**: Cache eligibility → Bypass cache

### 7. Speed Optimization

Go to **Speed** → **Optimization**:

Enable these settings:
- ✅ **Auto Minify**: Check JavaScript, CSS, HTML
- ✅ **Brotli** - Better compression than gzip
- ✅ **Rocket Loader** - Defer JavaScript loading (test this, may break some apps)
- ✅ **Mirage** - Image optimization for mobile

**Image Optimization (Polish):**
- Go to **Speed** → **Optimization** → **Polish**
- Select **Lossless** (or Lossy for smaller files)
- Enable **WebP** conversion

### 8. Security Settings

Go to **Security** → **Settings**:

**Security Level**: Auromatically on high protection
- I'm Under Attack!: Use only during active DDoS attacks

**Bot Fight Mode**: ✅ Enable
- Free protection against automated bots

**Challenge Passage**: 30 minutes
- How long a passed challenge is valid

- Blocks known malicious browsers

### 9. Firewall Rules (Optional)

Go to **Security** → **WAF** → **Firewall Rules**:

**Example Rule: Block Access to Admin Paths**
```
Rule name: Block Admin Paths
When incoming requests match:
  (http.request.uri.path contains "/admin" and not ip.src in {YOUR_IP_ADDRESS})
Then: Block
```

**Example Rule: Rate Limiting on API**
```
Rule name: Rate Limit API
When incoming requests match:
  (http.request.uri.path starts with "/api/")
Then: Challenge (after X requests per Y seconds)
```

### 10. Page Rules (Optional but Useful)

Go to **Rules** → **Page Rules**:

**Example Rules:**

**Rule 1: Force HTTPS on All Pages**
- URL: `http://*teamshots.vip/*`
- Setting: Always Use HTTPS

**Rule 2: Cache Static Content**
- URL: `*teamshots.vip/static/*`
- Settings:
  - Cache Level: Cache Everything
  - Edge Cache TTL: 1 month
  - Browser Cache TTL: 1 month

**Rule 3: Bypass Cache for API**
- URL: `*teamshots.vip/api/*`
- Setting: Cache Level: Bypass

### 11. Network Settings

Go to **Network**:

- ✅ **HTTP/2**: Enable (enabled by default)
- ✅ **HTTP/3 (with QUIC)**: Enable (faster, experimental)
- ✅ **0-RTT Connection Resumption**: Enable (faster reconnects)
- ✅ **IPv6 Compatibility**: Enable
- ✅ **WebSockets**: Enable (required for real-time features)
- ⚠️ **gRPC**: Enable only if you use gRPC

### 12. Analytics & Monitoring

Go to **Analytics & Logs** → **Web Analytics**:

Cloudflare provides free analytics:
- Traffic volume
- Bandwidth usage
- Threats blocked
- Response codes
- Top countries/IPs
- Cache performance

**No setup needed** - analytics are automatic!

### 13. Custom Error Pages (Optional)

Go to **Custom Pages**:

Customize error pages for:
- 500 Internal Server Error
- 502 Bad Gateway
- 503 Service Unavailable
- 504 Gateway Timeout
- 1000 Cloudflare Error

Upload custom HTML for better branding.

### 14. Email Routing (Required for Your App)

Your app uses the following email addresses (configured in `src/config/brand.ts`):

**Emails Used in TeamShots:**
- `hello@teamshots.vip` - FROM address for waitlist welcome emails
- `support@teamshots.vip` - REPLY-TO address for customer support
- `privacy@teamshots.vip` - Privacy-related inquiries
- `legal@teamshots.vip` - Legal-related inquiries

**Setup Email Forwarding:**

1. Go to **Email** → **Email Routing** in Cloudflare
2. Click **Get Started** / **Enable Email Routing**
3. **Add Destination Address** (your personal email where you want to receive emails):
   - Enter your personal email (e.g., `yourname@gmail.com`)
   - Verify it (Cloudflare sends verification email)
   
4. **Create Routing Rules** for each email address:

   **Rule 1: Hello (Waitlist Emails)**
   - Match incoming emails: `hello@teamshots.vip`
   - Action: Forward to → `yourname@gmail.com`
   - Priority: 1

   **Rule 2: Support (Customer Support)**
   - Match incoming emails: `support@teamshots.vip`
   - Action: Forward to → `yourname@gmail.com`
   - Priority: 2

   **Rule 3: Privacy**
   - Match incoming emails: `privacy@teamshots.vip`
   - Action: Forward to → `yourname@gmail.com`
   - Priority: 3

   **Rule 4: Legal**
   - Match incoming emails: `legal@teamshots.vip`
   - Action: Forward to → `yourname@gmail.com`
   - Priority: 4

   **Optional: Catch-All Rule**
   - Match incoming emails: `*@teamshots.vip` (catch everything else)
   - Action: Forward to → `yourname@gmail.com`
   - Priority: 5

5. Cloudflare will **automatically add required DNS records**:
   - MX records (for receiving emails)
   - TXT records (SPF, DKIM for email authentication)

**Important Notes:**

- **Sending Emails**: Your app sends emails through **Resend** (not Cloudflare)
- **Receiving Emails**: Cloudflare forwards replies to your personal email
- **Reply Handling**: When users reply to waitlist emails, they go to `support@teamshots.vip` which forwards to you
- **Multiple Recipients**: You can forward the same address to multiple emails (e.g., support goes to you AND your team)

**Example Use Cases:**
- User signs up → Receives email from `hello@teamshots.vip` (sent via Resend)
- User replies → Email goes to `support@teamshots.vip` → Forwarded to your Gmail
- Privacy inquiry → Someone emails `privacy@teamshots.vip` → Forwarded to you

**Pro Tip**: Consider using different personal emails for different purposes:
- `hello@` and `support@` → Your main support email
- `privacy@` → Compliance team email
- `legal@` → Legal team or attorney email

### Verification After Setup

Once Cloudflare is active:

```bash
# Check if Cloudflare is active (should see Cloudflare IPs, not your server IP)
dig www.teamshots.vip +short

# Check SSL certificate (should show Cloudflare)
curl -vI https://www.teamshots.vip 2>&1 | grep -i "issuer"

# Check response headers (should see cf-ray and cf-cache-status)
curl -I https://www.teamshots.vip
```

**Expected Headers:**
```
cf-ray: xxxxx-XXX
cf-cache-status: HIT or MISS
server: cloudflare
```

### Important Notes

**Coolify + Cloudflare Compatibility:**
- ✅ Coolify's Let's Encrypt SSL works perfectly with Cloudflare Full (strict) mode
- ✅ Cloudflare sees Coolify's valid SSL certificate
- ✅ Both provide SSL - double protection!

**Initial Setup Time:**
- Nameserver propagation: 2-48 hours (usually <2 hours)
- SSL provisioning: 5-15 minutes after nameservers are active
- Cloudflare becomes active immediately after nameserver change

**Cache Purging:**
- Go to **Caching** → **Configuration** → **Purge Cache**
- Options: Purge Everything, Purge by URL, Purge by Tag
- Use after deploying new code if cached pages don't update

**Development Mode:**
- Go to **Caching** → **Configuration**
- Enable **Development Mode** temporarily (3 hours)
- Bypasses cache while developing
- Automatically disables after 3 hours

docker exec -i teamshots-db psql -U teamshots_user teamshots < backup.sql
```

### Application Updates

1. **Dependencies**: Update package.json locally, test, then deploy
2. **Database Schema**: Run migrations locally first, then production
3. **Environment Variables**: Update in Coolify UI

### Server Maintenance

```bash
# Update system packages
apt update && apt upgrade -y

# Clean Docker
docker system prune -a

# Check disk space
df -h

# Check memory
free -h

# Monitor processes
htop
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Application Won't Start

**Symptoms**: Container crashes immediately

**Debug Steps:**
```bash
# View logs in Coolify or:
docker logs [container-id]

# Common causes:
# - Missing environment variables
# - Database connection failed
# - Port already in use
```

#### 2. SSL Certificate Issues

**Symptoms**: Certificate not provisioning

**Solutions:**
- Verify DNS points to server (wait 15 min for propagation)
- Check port 80/443 are open in firewall
- Ensure domain is correctly configured in Coolify
- Check Let's Encrypt rate limits

#### 3. Database Connection Fails

**Symptoms**: "Can't connect to database" errors

**Debug:**
```bash
# Check database is running
docker ps | grep postgres

# Test connection from app container
docker exec -it [app-container] psql $DATABASE_URL

# Check connection string format
echo $DATABASE_URL
```

#### 4. Deployment Stuck/Hanging

**Solutions:**
- Check build logs for errors
- Verify Dockerfile builds locally
- Increase build timeout in Coolify
- Check disk space: `df -h`

#### 5. Domain Not Resolving

**Debug:**
```bash
# Check DNS
dig www.teamshots.vip +short

# Check server is listening
netstat -tulpn | grep :443

# Test locally
curl -I http://94.130.225.35:3000
```

## Security Best Practices

### Server Security

- [ ] Keep system updated: `apt update && apt upgrade`
- [ ] Configure Hetzner Cloud Firewall (recommended over UFW)
- [ ] Use SSH keys only (disable password authentication)
- [ ] Restrict SSH access to known IP addresses (optional)
- [ ] Let Coolify Cloud manage Docker security
- [ ] Enable fail2ban for additional brute force protection (optional)
- [ ] Regular security audits and updates

### Application Security

- [ ] All environment variables stored in Coolify Cloud (never in code)
- [ ] Sensitive variables marked as "Secret" (eye icon)
- [ ] HTTPS only (automatic force redirect by Coolify)
- [ ] Security headers configured in Next.js
- [ ] Regular dependency updates (`npm audit`, Dependabot)
- [ ] Database backups enabled in Coolify Cloud
- [ ] Database not publicly accessible (internal network only)

### Monitoring

- [ ] Enable Coolify Cloud email alerts (deployment, errors)
- [ ] Set up external uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot, Pingdom) - optional
- [ ] Configure error tracking (Sentry) - optional but recommended
- [ ] Coolify Cloud automatically monitors SSL expiration
- [ ] Track performance metrics (Coolify Cloud built-in)
- [ ] Set up Discord/Slack notifications in Coolify Cloud

## Cost Estimate

**Monthly Costs (USD):**
- Hetzner VPS (CPX21): ~$9
- Domain (teamshots.vip): ~$12/year = $1/month
- Cloudflare: Free (CDN, DDoS protection, SSL, caching) → $0
- Resend Email: Free tier (100/day) → $0
- Coolify Cloud: Free tier (1 server) or $5/month (Pro plan)
- **Total**: ~$10-15/month

**As you scale:**
- Upgrade VPS as needed (CPX31: ~$14/month, CPX41: ~$27/month)
- Cloudflare Pro: $20/month (more page rules, better WAF, image optimization)
- Resend paid tier if >100 emails/day ($10-20/month)
- Database backups to S3 (~$1-5/month)
- Cloudflare Images: $5/month for 100k images (if needed)

## Quick Command Reference

### Via Coolify Cloud Dashboard (Recommended)

- **View Logs**: Application → Logs tab (real-time)
- **Restart App**: Application → Settings → Restart button
- **Run Migrations**: Application → Console → `npx prisma migrate deploy`
- **Database Console**: Database → Console tab
- **Manual Deploy**: Application → Deploy button

### Via SSH (Advanced)

```bash
# SSH to server
ssh root@[YOUR_SERVER_IP]

# View running containers
docker ps

# View application logs (if needed)
docker logs -f [container-name]

# Restart application (use Coolify Cloud instead)
docker restart [container-name]

# Database backup (manual)
docker exec teamshots-db pg_dump -U teamshots_user teamshots > backup.sql

# Enter database console
docker exec -it teamshots-db psql -U teamshots_user teamshots

# Run migrations (use Coolify Cloud Console instead)
docker exec -it [app-container] npx prisma migrate deploy

# Check disk space
df -h

# Update system
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

**Note**: Most operations can be done through the Coolify Cloud dashboard, which is easier and safer than direct SSH access.
