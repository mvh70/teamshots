# Value Proposition

# TeamShots Value Proposition

## The pain we remove
- Organizing team photos is slow, expensive, and painful (scheduling, studio, retakes)
- New hires break visual consistency and force repeat shoots
- Distributed teams can’t get in one room, delaying website and press updates

## What we do
Turn any team selfie into consistent, on-brand headshots in under 60 seconds — no photographer, no coordination.

## Why it matters (for buyers)
- Faster go‑live: keep your site, press kit, and org pages always up to date
- Lower cost: replace $50–$200 per person shoots with on‑demand AI
- Brand consistency: one look across the whole team, including new joiners

## What makes us different
- Designed for teams: one spec, everyone matches automatically
- On‑brand: choose background, attire, and optional logo placement
- 100% remote: each person uploads once; results are instant

## How it works (5 steps)
1. Define the background scene (or upload your own)
2. Upload your logo (optional)
3. Choose the style (formal/casual) or upload a reference
4. Your team uploads their selfies
5. Results: consistent, on‑brand photos ready to download

## One‑line summary (use in marketing)
“Professional, consistent team photos in 60 seconds — without a photoshoot.”
