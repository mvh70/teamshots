# Value Proposition

# TeamShots Value Proposition

## The pain we remove
- Organizing team photos is slow, expensive, and painful (scheduling, studio, retakes)
- New hires break visual consistency and force repeat shoots
- Distributed teams can't get in one room, delaying website and press updates
- Individual professionals need high-quality headshots without studio costs

## What we do
Turn any selfie into professional headshots in under 60 seconds using AI.

## Why it matters (for buyers)

### For Teams
- Faster go‑live: keep your site, press kit, and org pages always up to date
- Lower cost: replace $50–$200 per person shoots with on‑demand AI ($2-5/photo with volume discounts)
- Brand consistency: one look across the whole team, including new joiners
- Scalable pricing: Volume discounts from $29/seat down to $15.96/seat for larger teams

### For Individuals
- Professional headshots without expensive photo sessions
- Quick turnaround for LinkedIn, websites, or business profiles
- High-quality results from any smartphone photo

## What makes us different
- Domain-based specialization: photoshotspro.com (individuals) vs teamshotspro.com (teams)
- Designed for both audiences: flexible packages for different needs
- On‑brand: choose background, attire, and optional logo placement
- 100% remote: upload once; results are instant

## How it works (5 steps)
1. Choose your plan based on domain (individual vs team)
2. Define the background scene (or upload your own)
3. Upload your logo (optional for teams)
4. Choose the style (formal/casual) or upload a reference
5. Upload selfies and get professional results instantly

## One‑line summary (use in marketing)
"Professional headshots in 60 seconds — for individuals and teams."
